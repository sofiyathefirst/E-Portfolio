                                <br /> During the interview session, I was quite nervous because of the position that I ask is quite high.
                                <br /> The interview session went well, I've been accepted to be one of the exco's.
                                <br /> My first event with COMPASS is FSKM Meet and Greet which is we collaborate with MATICS club.
                                <br /> The first event went well, they also teach and guide me how to handle a big event like that.
                                <br /> As a new member, I was given the task to do live update on social media.
                                <br /> My second semester are full with cocuricular activities which is also balance with my study.
                                <br /> When I started join COMPASS, the team members of COMPASS add up more fun in my diploma year.

                                            <br /> On my third semester, I was given task by my club's President to handle an Annual General Meeting event.
                                            <br /> This is my first time of handle an event. The event went well and it was a big success.
                                            <br /> After that, since it was the semester for the new intake, we have to do an induction for them.
                                            <br /> Induction is like a mini team building for the part 1 students to build their leadership and also to
                                            <br /> knowing each other. During the induction day, I was the coach for the zumba activity in the morning.
                                            <br /> This also helps me a lot to build my confident level. After that, all of the exco's were going to a team
                                            <br /> building program. During the program, we had a lot of fun and gain so much more knowledge.
                                            <br /> We also have a Pre Graduation Dinner which we have a collaboration with MATICS club as we are both
                                            <br /> club under FSKM. Since the third semester is the last semester that we can spend our time with our senior,
                                            <br /> so this semester is quite emotional for me. My senior were very kind and very caring towards each other. 
                                            <br /> They makes me feel like a family in COMPASS.

                                        <br /> is not an easy job. I was shocked and will try my best to be a good president. To be a great

                                        <br /> But my four semester doesnt go well as I expected because of the Covid-19 virus.
                                        <br /> Due to the pandemic reason, all of us need to study at home.Online Distance Learning
                                        <br /> are very hard for the first time. There is so many miscommunication and the
                                        <br /> time provided itself are very short.During the ODL session, me myself facing
                                        <br /> a very though time due to slow internet connection and lack of sleep.
                                        <br /> Some of my friends with bad environment at home are very struggle during this
                                        <br /> pandemic. We are very uncomfortable with the new norma, but for now we need to
                                        <br /> survive with it.I was thinking that I might not survive my fourth semester, but
                                        <br /> Alhamdulillah with my families and friends support, I did it.

                                            <br /> education said that we can proceed with face to face learning session, but for some
                                            <br /> reason we need to continue it with ODL. At this point, I was very sad and fell
                                            <br /> like I cannot do much on my final semester with my friends and my club.
                                            <br /> But I will take this as a challenge for me. So i decided to continue
                                            <br /> my ODL at my university due to my environment at home are not comfortable.
                                            <br /> So far, my fifth semester went very well. Spent my time with my roommates
                                            <br /> before we went on our seperate ways. But still, what I missed the most at
                                            <br /> the moment is to ahve a face to face class, meet and go out with my friends.
                                            <br /> I am hoping for the current situation wiil heal and turn back to the normal
                                            <br /> good old days.So that I can meet my friends, going back home meeting my
                                            <br /> families and going out without any fear of the virus. I know that all of the
                                            <br /> frontliners now trying very hard to save our country from the virus.
                                            <br /> Big salutation towards our frontliners and to all the citizen that
                                            <br /> follow all the SOP that our government has state.
